# Bunker Hill Monument 3D Reconstruction Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for the 3D reconstruction of the Bunker Hill Monument using images derived from video. This project utilizes advanced photogrammetry techniques, leveraging tools like Bundler and PMVS to create detailed and accurate 3D models.

## Technologies Used
- **Bundler**: Used for generating a sparse 3D point cloud from overlapping images.
- **PMVS (Patch-based Multi-view Stereo Software)**: Enhances the sparse model into a dense point cloud, providing a detailed texture of the monument.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing operations, particularly for transforming video into a series of images.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for scripting and automation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bunkerhill-reconstruction.git
